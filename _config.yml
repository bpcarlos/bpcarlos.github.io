  I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems in the Freie Universität Berlin. In particular, I am currently working in Jens Eisert's group. I got my PhD in quantum computation and information under the supervision of José Ignacio Latorre at the Universitat de Barcelona, where I initially studied a BSc in Physics. I also have an MSc in Photonics from the Institute of Photonics Sciences (ICFO). While doing my PhD, I had the opportunity to work as a researcher in different institutions. I spent my two first years of PhD as a Research Engineer at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. After, I spent two more years as an Associate Researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi.

  I am highly interested in quantum technologies and, specifically, quantum computing. My research is focused on quantum algorithms, quantum information, condensed matter physics, and machine learning. Without a doubt, what interests me the most is the intersection of the aforementioned topics.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
